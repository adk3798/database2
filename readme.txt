Setup assumes you have files from our submission

Setup:
  - Create database called DB2
  - Run the file setup.sql on that database to create tables and populate database
  - Create a new folder within [Your xampp install directory]/xampp/htdocs/dashboard
  - Place all files within newly created folder
  - You should now have a folder [Your xampp install directory]/xampp/htdocs/dashboard/[Your folder name] that contains
     ~ add_sm.php
     ~ admin_login.php
     ~ edit_info.php
     ~ landing.php
     ~ logout.php
     ~ meeting_assign.php
     ~ meeting_info.php
     ~ meeting_signup.php
     ~ mentee_assign.php
     ~ mentor_assign.php
     ~ parent_login.php
     ~ parent_registration.php
     ~ readme.txt
     ~ setup.sql
     ~ student_login.php
     ~ student_registration.php
     ~ study_materials.php
     ~ view_sm.php
     ~ view2_sm.php
  - If all files are present, go to the default page for xampp (should be something/dashboard) and 
       append /landing.php to the url to access the site
       (for me the url is "localhost/dashboard/project/landing.php")
